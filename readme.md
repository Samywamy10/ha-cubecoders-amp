# Cubecoders AMP HA Integration

Integrates with [AMP](https://cubecoders.com/AMP) to create devices out of each game server, and then provides a number of entities per server.

Install to [HACS by adding a custom repository](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/) and then including this repository. Then search `Cubecoders AMP` in HACS; restart Home Assistant, then add the `AMP` integration.
